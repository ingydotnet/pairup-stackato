# PairUp! - The Stackato based pair programming environment.
name: pairup

# No framework needed. We just want the container's unix environment.
framework:
  type: generic

# Needed by stackato 1.2. Container needs to respond to web request to appear
# alive. We serve the README file, since it is already available.
processes:
  web: while true; do nc -l $PORT -q 1 < README.md; done

# Good to have lots of memory. Low memory seems to cause apt-get failures.
mem: 256M

# This shared fs is useful for keeping stuff you don't want to lose, like your
# code repositories.
services:
  pairup: filesystem

# This allows the .git/ directory to get pushed. Good for hacking on 'pairup'
# itself.
